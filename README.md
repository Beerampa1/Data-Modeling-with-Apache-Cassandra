# Project-Data-Modeling-with-Apache-Cassandra
A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analysis team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, there is no easy way to query the data to generate the results, since the data reside in a directory of CSV files on user activity on the app.

In this project,I have created an ETL pipeline that transfers data from a set of CSV files within a directory to create a streamlined CSV file for modeling and inserting data into Apache Cassandra tables.

I have answered the queries for the project and attached the notebook file. A detailed explanation is provided in the notebook file.
